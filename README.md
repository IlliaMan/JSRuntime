# JS Runtime

This project implements a JS runtime that supports a subset of JS.

- **Subset of JavaScript:** Supports a limited set of JS features.
- **Single File Execution:** Only supports one JavaScript file at a timeâ€”no support for modules.

## Usage
```bash
cargo run -- <path_to_js_file>
```
